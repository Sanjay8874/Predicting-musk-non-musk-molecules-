Predicting-musk-non-musk-molecules To predict: whether new molecules will be musks or non-musks.
The given dataset contains details about­ organic chemical compounds including their chemical features, isomeric conformation, names and the classes in which they are classified. The compounds are classified as either ‘Musk’ or ‘Non-Musk’ compounds.

To complete the Musk and Non-Musk Molecules task I use Convolution Neural Network(CNN).
There are 4 Step I take to Build CNN.
1-Convolution
2-Max-Pooling
3-Flattening
4-Full Connection
